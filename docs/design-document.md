## Introduction

This the course project of advanced database systems at New York University. The project is to implement a simple version of distributed database, complete with multiversion concurrency control, deadlock detection, replication and failure recovery. Normally, this is a multi-year, multi-person effort, but it's doable because the database is tiny.

This project is to make us have deep insight into the design of distributed systems.
